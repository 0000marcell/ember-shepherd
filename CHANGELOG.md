We will list changes, especially breaking changes, between versions here.

###**2.0.9**
* Merged https://github.com/shipshapecode/ember-shepherd/pull/45 which enabled recalculating of the positioning of the `highlightElement`, created by `copyStyles`.
* Merged https://github.com/shipshapecode/ember-shepherd/pull/46 which replaced the use of `.cssText` with some more cross browser friendly methods.

###**2.0.5**
* Merged https://github.com/rwwagner90/ember-shepherd/pull/37 which added support for `scrollTo:true` and `disableScroll:true`, so the elements will still scroll into view, but the user is not able to manually scroll.

###**2.0.4**

* Added @craigsketchley 's email to bower.json and package.json

* Merged https://github.com/rwwagner90/ember-shepherd/pull/33 to set pointer-events back to `'auto'` on cancel or exit

###**2.0.0**

* Fixed an issue with defaults not actually being applied because they were undefined at the time `init` was called

###**1.1.0**

* Must now use `tour.start()` instead of `tour.trigger('start')`
* tour now emits events, instead of the tour object
* tour now emits events for *all* actions `next`, `back`, `complete`, `cancel`, `start`
